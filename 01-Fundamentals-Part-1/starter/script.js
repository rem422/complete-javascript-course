//DATA TYPES
// JavaScript has dynamic typing: We do not have to manually define the data type of the value stored in a variable. Instead, data types are defined automatically.

//premitive data types

//1. Number: Floating point numbers used for decimals and integers
    let age = 23;
//2. String: Sequence of characters used for text
    let middleName = 'Jonas';

//3. Boolean: Logical type that can only be true or false used for taking decisions
    let fullage = true;

//4. Undefined: Value taken by a variable that is not yet defined('Empty value')
    let children;

//5. Null: Also means ('Empty value') for now
    let myAge;

//6. Symbol (ES2015): Value that is unique and cannot be changed [Not useful for now]

//7. Symbol (ES2020): Large integers than the Number type can hold
